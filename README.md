## 👶 The Beginning: Where It All Started
Once upon a time (about 2 years ago), I started my **CSS journey**. Back then, I was just vibing with colors, borders, and funny coding experiments. This repo holds those *golden* moments when I first tried to make things look cool (and sometimes failed hilariously 😆).

> **"It is what it is."** - Me, looking at my first CSS commits.

In this repo, you'll find **very basic CSS**, my initial struggles, and how I learned the ropes. This was my playground where I committed every chapter I learned. 🎢

## 🔥 The Comeback: Learning CSS 2.0
Fast forward **2 years later**, I’m now working as a **Software Developer** 💻. And guess what? I’m back at it again! This time, I want to **master** all those CSS concepts I completely skipped (or ignored 🙃) before.

So, I created a new folder: **Learn-2.0** 📂

📌 **What's Inside Learn-2.0?**
- This folder contains all the advanced CSS concepts I’m learning *now*.
- Every commit is a step towards **mastering CSS**.
- More structured, more informative, and way more refined than before.

💡 *Think of it as CSS-Learning: The Sequel 🎬.*

## 🚀 Why This Repo Exists?
- To track my **CSS evolution** from beginner to pro.
- To have a collection of **cool CSS tricks & concepts**.
- To help others who might be on the same journey! 🌍
